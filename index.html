    The Indian Premier League (IPL) is a professional Twenty20 cricket league in India organised by the Board ofControl for Cricket in India (BCCI).[1] Founded in 2007, the league features ten 
    state-based or city-based franchise teams.[2] The IPL is the most popular and richest cricket league in the world and is held between March and May. It has an exclusive window in the Future 
    Tours Programme of the International Cricket Council (ICC), resulting in fewer international cricket tours occurring during the IPL seasons.[3] It is also the most viewed sports competition 
    in India, as per the BroadcastAudience Research Council.[4][5]
            <br><br>
    In 2010, the IPL became the first sporting event to be broadcast live on YouTube.[6][7] In 2014, it ranked sixth in attendance among all sports leagues.[8] Inspired by the success of the IPL,
    other Indian sports leagues have been established.[a][11][12] IPL is the second-richest sports league in theworld by per-match value, after the NFL.[13] In 2023, the league sold its media 
    rights for the next 4seasons for US$6.4 billion to Viacom18 and Star Sports,[14] which meant that each IPL match was valued at $13.4 million.[15] As of 2024, there have been seventeen seasons 
    of the tournament. The current champions are the Kolkata Knight Riders, who won the 2024 season after defeating the Sunrisers Hyderabad in the final.[16] In just six years, the IPL's value 
    has more than doubled, reaching $12 billion in 2024.[17]

    <h1>HISTORY</h1>
    <div>
        
            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>
    In April 2007, the Essel Group launched the Indian Cricket League (ICL), in partnership with IL&FS.[18][19]The ICL was not recognized by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) or the
    International Cricket Council (ICC). Moreover, the BCCI was unhappy about its committee members joining the ICL executiveboard.[20][21] In response, the BCCI increased the prize money for its 
    domestic tournaments and imposed lifetime bans on players who joined the ICL, which it considered a rebel league.[22][23]
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h2>Foundation</h2>
    <p>On 13 September 2007, as the 2007 ICC World Twenty20 began, the BCCI launched the Indian Premier League, anannual franchise-based Twenty20 cricket competition.[24] The inaugural season was 
    scheduled to start in April 2008, commencing with a "high-profile ceremony" in New Delhi. BCCI Vice-president Lalit Modi, who ledthe IPL initiative, provided details of the tournament, 
    including its format, prize money, franchise evenue system, and squad composition rules. The league, to be managed by a seven-person governing council,would also serve as the qualifying mechanism 
    for that year's Champions League Twenty20.[24][25]
        <br><br>
    To determine team ownership, an auction for the franchises was held on 24 January 2008. The reserve pricesfor the eight franchises totalled $400 million,[23] but the auction ultimately raised 
    $723.59 million.[26] The league officially commenced in April 2008, featuring Chennai Super Kings (CSK), Mumbai Indians (MI), Delhi Daredevils (DD), Kings XI Punjab (KXIP), Deccan Chargers (DC), 
    Rajasthan Royals (RR), Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR), and Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB).[27]
        <br><br>
    In 2009, the BCCI and other national boards offered amnesty to rival ICL's players and officials, provided they terminated their contracts. The resulting player exodus and financial difficulties 
    forced ICL to shut down later that year.[28][29][30]
